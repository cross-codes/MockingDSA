/**
 * A resizable, array-backed list implementation optimized for fast insertions
 * and deletions at arbitrary positions.
 * {@code ShiftList} divides its backing array into blocks and uses per-block
 * rotation and a global offset
 * adjustment to minimize data movement during modifications.
 *
 * <p>
 * The block size is not fixed, but rather derived from the list's capacity: it
 * increases as capacity grows, generally
 * maintaining an approximate ratio where the number of blocks is similar to the
 * block size. This design balances the cost
 * of shifting elements within a block versus adjusting per-block rotation
 * state. Empirically chosen block sizes ensure
 * high performance across a wide range of list sizes, slightly favoring fewer
 * blocks and more intra-block shifting for
 * better overall throughput.
 *
 * <p>
 * Insertions or removals at the very start or end of the list are typically
 * amortized {@code O(1)}. Operations that
 * affect only a single block (such as insertions or removals near the start or
 * end) complete in {@code O(1)} to
 * {@code O(blockSize)} time, depending on the fill level and rotation of the
 * affected block. Performance degrades
 * gradually as modifications approach the middle, where more blocks may be
 * involved. The general-case modification cost
 * remains bounded by {@code O(n / blockSize)}
 *
 * <p>
 * Random access operations ({@code get}, {@code set}) are constant-time and
 * extremely fast, with a low constant factor.
 * This makes {@code ShiftList} particularly well-suited for applications
 * requiring efficient indexed access.
 *
 * <p>
 * The list grows dynamically as elements are added. The overhead to store
 * {@code n} elements is, on average,
 * {@code n * 1.5}. The growth strategy ensures amortized {@code O(1)} cost for
 * appends and insertions at either end.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code ShiftList} supports all optional operations of the
 * {@link java.util.List} and {@link java.util.Deque}
 * interfaces. It is fail-fast, allows {@code null} elements, and provides
 * constant-time {@code clear()} and {@code size()}.
 * Sublist views are supported via {@link java.util.AbstractList}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is <strong>not thread-safe</strong>. External synchronization must
 * be used if accessed concurrently
 * by multiple threads. Consider wrapping the list with
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedList}.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code ShiftList} can be used as a drop-in replacement for {@code ArrayList}
 * or {@code LinkedList} in scenarios where
 * frequent (mid-list) insertions or deletions are performance-sensitive.
 *
 * <h2>Limitations</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Minimum capacity is fixed at 16 elements.</li>
 * <li>Maximum capacity is limited to {@code 2^30 - 65536} elements, due to
 * internal design constraints preventing
 * both the first and last elements from residing in the same block.</li>
 * <li>Automatic shrinking of the backing array is not supported, except via
 * {@link #clear()}, which resets the structure.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Planned Enhancements</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Optimized iterator for improved traversal performance.</li>
 * <li>Optimized bulk insertions and removals.</li>
 * <li>Automatic shrinking of the backing array when appropriate.</li>
 * <li>Serialization support.</li>
 * </ul>
